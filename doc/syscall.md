# System Calls

The kernel exposes the system calls to the user-space by the syscall instruction.

## System Call ABI
Arguments are passed to the kernel through the x86_64 registers rdi, rsi, rdx, r8, r9 and r10. The return value is passed through the rax register.
Errno also gets passed through rax, as -errno.
